# Antenna-data
The "Uniform" folder includes 9 groups of array antenna simulation data with array sizes from 14 to 22.
Each group of the simulation data consists of 10000 samples.
Each sample is made up of position errors and the corresponding electrical performance parameters, including the maximum power density (MPD), half power bandwidth (BW), pointing angle (PA), and first side lobe level (FSLL).
The position error data are generated by the conical sampling method (Paper: "A position error representation method for planar arrays").
The corresponding electrical performance parameters are calculated according to antenna theories with the amplitude and phase equally weighted.
